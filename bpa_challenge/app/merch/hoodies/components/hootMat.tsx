The outer fabric features a smooth finish, while the inside is lined with a soft fleece material that offers a cozy, warm feel perfect for cooler weather. The cotton content ensures breathability, while the polyester enhances the fabricâ€™s resilience, making it resistant to shrinking and fading over time.
