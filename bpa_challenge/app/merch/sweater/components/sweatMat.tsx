The outer layer features a soft, brushed fleece finish that traps warmth while providing a cozy feel against your skin. The cotton fibers contribute to its breathability, ensuring you stay comfortable all day long, while the polyester adds strength and resilience to the fabric, helping the sweater retain its shape and color over time.
